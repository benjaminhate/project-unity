# Unity Roguelike Procedural Generation

The project is a Unity game for a roguelike game. The game has a procedurally generated dungeon where the player can walk through.

The game is a 2D roguelike where the player has to escape the dungeon full of gards.
The player can take the appearence of the gards for a short duration during which the gards won't detect him.
The dungeon is procedurally generated and the gards are randomly placed and their stats are randomly defined.

A difficulty level increases the difficulty of the dungeon.
If the player escapes a dungeon, he will enter a more difficult one.
